# COMP 170 SU25 WEEK 04

This assignment has two parts: a coding part based on current material we discuss in class and a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted.

# Finals week policy

There is no final exam for the course. There will be a final assignemnt that will be published the week before finals and will be due the week of finals. Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. The final exam slot for this course is on Tuesday, August 5, 2025 from 11 AM to 1 PM. If you are selected for a brief meeting, we'll spend about 15 minutes during the final exam slot to review your work. This interview will cover coding practices based on your past assignments. It is meant as a checkpoint to ensure that you have internalized the work you submitted.

# Code

This assignment has 5 tasks. Write your code in file `week04.py`. The file comes with a bit of testing code. Do not modify the testing code. Write your methods *above* the testing code. If your methods are correct, running the testing code will show that you passed the tests. In addition to correct logic, your methods must have **one and only one** return statement each. Useful comments are required.


## Find the longest word
Write a method with header
```python
def longest_word(words: list[str]) -> str:
```
that returns the longest word (that is the longest string) in list `words`.


## Find the shortest word
Write a method with header
```python
def shortest_word(words: list[str]) -> str:
```
that returns the shortest word (that is the longest string) in list `words`.


## Find odd words
Write a method with header
```python
def odd_words(words: list[str]) -> list[str]:
```
that returns a list with all the strings in list `words` whose length is an odd number.


## Find average words
Write a method with header
```python
def average_words(words: list[str]) -> list[str]:
```
that returns a list with all the strings in `words` whose length is $\pm 1$ from the average length of all strings in `words`.


## Find an intersection
Write a method with header
```python
def intersect(foo: list[str], bar: list[str]) -> bool:
```
that returns `True` if lists `foo` and `bar` have at least one element in common, anf `False` otherwise. 

# Reflect

Review the posted [solutions from the previous assignment](./solutions_week03.py). Compare the posted solutions with your solutions. Notice the differences between your code and the solutions code and describe them. Trivial differences like the names of variables are not that important unless your names are really - I mean, *really -* weird.

## Frequent mistakes expected at this point

* **Code has no comments** to demonstrate mastery of the program.

* **Code does not produce correct outputs** because it was not tested after completed.

* **Code uses excessive logic** which may be the sign of AI-generated programs.

* **Code does not include type hints (annotations).** This is also typical with solutions found online or are AI-generated.
